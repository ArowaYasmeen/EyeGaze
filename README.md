# EyeGaze
EyeGaze is a project prototype we built for our HCI course project (CSE 4849) in our 4-2 Semester in 2021. 

The objective of EyeGaze is to control and interact with the Computer User Interface (UI) with just our eye gaze instead of the usual touch sensors.

This is a simple prototype and the demo to how to use the code can be found in the video-demo folder. The video-demo folders also contains video demo of two possible uses of our system.

The codes are present in the folder EyeGazeDetection.

The Adobe XD files can be found in he Visual Wireframe folder.
